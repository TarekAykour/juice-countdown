            <p style={{fontFamily: 'arial'}}> On friday 14 April 2023 the ESA launched JUICE (Jupiter's Icy Moons) on a 8 year old journey to 
                the gas giant "Jupiter" and it's icy moons, one which is Europa which got discovered by Galileo back in 1610.
                If you want to know more, go to this <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/juice">link</a> as i am too lazy to type further.
                Anyway, the purpose of this website is to keep track of the amount of days left until JUICE reaches Jupiter ( I hope that GTA 6 gets released before that time). I as a programmer and a space enthousiast
                had to create the website, because why not? I will keep updating the website with some nice features that i got in my mind. You could also
                give your ideas in the <a href="/ideas">ideas</a> page and-/or under my <a href="#linktovideo">YouTube video</a>. Keep Juicing (cringe).
